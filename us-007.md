- [ ] Add blog post filtering by tags, categories, and date
- [ ] Create a search results page with highlighted matching content
- [ ] Implement search suggestions and autocomplete functionality
- [ ] Add saved search functionality for returning visitors
- [ ] Ensure search is responsive and works well on all devices
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for search functionality
- [ ] Implement search analytics to track popular searches

## Technical Details

### Search Engine Component
- Create a comprehensive search engine that indexes all content

- Content type filtering (projects, blog posts, etc.)
- Technology stack filtering for projects
- Tag and category filtering for blog posts
- Date range filtering for all content
- Search result highlighting and snippets
- Search history and saved searches
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+K to focus search)

### Filtering Features
- Multi-select technology filters
- Category checkboxes with counts
- Date range picker with presets
- Tag cloud with size-based importance
- Filter combinations with logic operators
- Active filter display with easy removal
- Filter URL persistence for sharing
- Mobile-optimized filter drawer

## Implementation Steps
1. Create search engine core (js/search-engine.js):
   - Implement content indexing system
   - Add full-text search with relevance ranking
   - Create fuzzy search algorithm
   - Handle search query parsing

2. Build search interface (components/search-interface.js):
   - Design global search bar component
   - Implement autocomplete suggestions
   - Add instant results dropdown
   - Create search results display

3. Implement filter panel (components/filter-panel.js):
   - Create dynamic filter components
   - Add multi-select functionality
   - Implement date range picker
   - Create tag cloud visualization

4. Create search results page (search-results.html):
   - Design comprehensive results layout
   - Implement result grouping and pagination
   - Add result highlighting
   - Include filtering sidebar

5. Update main navigation (index.html):
   - Add global search bar to header
   - Implement keyboard shortcuts
   - Add search toggle for mobile
   - Ensure responsive design

6. Implement search analytics (js/search-analytics.js):
   - Track search queries and results
   - Monitor popular searches
   - Track filter usage
   - Create analytics dashboard

7. Add search enhancements:
   - Implement search history
   - Add saved searches functionality
   - Create search result caching
   - Add search performance optimization

## Design Considerations
- Maintain consistency with the overall portfolio design
- Ensure search interface is intuitive and user-friendly
- Use appropriate typography hierarchy for search results
- Add subtle animations for search interactions
- Implement smooth transitions between search states
- Optimize for both desktop and mobile experiences

## Performance Considerations
- Implement efficient search indexing
- Use debouncing for search input
- Cache search results for common queries
- Optimize search algorithm for large content sets
- Implement lazy loading for search results
- Use web workers for intensive search operations

## Testing Strategy
- Test search with various query types and lengths
- Test filtering with different combinations
- Test search performance with large content sets
- Test responsiveness on different devices
- Test accessibility with keyboard navigation
- Test search analytics tracking
- Test error handling for invalid queries

## Notes
- Consider using a search library like Lunr.js or Fuse.js for advanced search capabilities
- The search system should index all content types (projects, blog posts, etc.)
- Search results should be ranked by relevance with multiple factors
- Consider implementing search result caching for improved performance
- The search interface should be easily accessible from any page
- Search analytics can provide insights into visitor interests

## Out of Scope
- Full-text search server implementation
- Machine learning-based search recommendations
- Advanced search query language
- Search result personalization
- Voice search functionality
- Search result A/B testing
- External search engine integration (Google, Bing, etc.)
