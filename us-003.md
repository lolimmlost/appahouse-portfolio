# User Story 3: Implement Blog Functionality

## Story
As a portfolio owner, I want to have a functional blog section that dynamically loads and displays my markdown blog posts, so that visitors can read my thoughts and tutorials on web development.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Create a blog renderer component that can parse markdown files
- [x] Implement dynamic loading of blog posts from the blog directory
- [x] Display blog post listings with title, excerpt, and metadata
- [x] Create a blog post detail view for individual posts
- [x] Add navigation between blog posts
- [x] Implement proper styling for blog content using Tailwind CSS
- [x] Add a "View All Posts" link that displays all blog posts
- [x] Ensure blog content is responsive and accessible

## Technical Details

### Blog Renderer Component
- Create a markdown parser to convert markdown files to HTML
- Handle code syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Extract metadata (title, date, excerpt) from markdown files
- Implement proper typography styling for blog content

### Blog Post Structure
Each blog post should follow this structure:
```markdown
---
title: "Blog Post Title"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
excerpt: "Brief description of the post"
---

# Blog Post Content

Markdown content goes here...
```

### Files to Create/Modify
1. `components/blog-renderer.js` - Blog rendering component (already exists, needs enhancement)
2. `js/blog.js` - Blog functionality and navigation
3. `blog-post.html` - Template for individual blog posts (new file)

### Blog Features
- Blog post listing with title, date, and excerpt
- Individual blog post view with full content
- Navigation between posts (previous/next)
- Reading time estimation
- Tags or categories for posts
- Search functionality (optional, for future enhancement)

## Implementation Steps
1. Enhance the existing blog-renderer.js component to:
   - Parse markdown frontmatter (metadata)
   - Convert markdown to HTML
   - Apply proper styling to blog content
   - Handle code syntax highlighting

2. Create blog functionality in js/blog.js:
   - Load blog posts from the blog directory
   - Generate blog post listings
   - Handle navigation to individual posts
   - Implement previous/next post navigation

3. Create blog-post.html template:
   - Use the same header and footer as index.html
   - Include blog content area
   - Add navigation elements

4. Update index.html:
   - Ensure the blog section properly loads blog posts
   - Add "View All Posts" functionality

5. Style the blog content:
   - Use Tailwind's typography plugin for blog content
   - Ensure proper spacing and readability
   - Style code blocks and other elements

## Design Considerations
- Maintain consistency with the overall portfolio design
- Ensure blog content is easy to read on all devices
- Use appropriate typography hierarchy
- Add subtle animations for interactions
- Implement smooth transitions between pages

## Performance Considerations
- Load blog posts asynchronously
- Implement lazy loading for blog content if needed
- Cache blog posts to improve performance
- Optimize images in blog posts

## Testing Strategy
- Test with various markdown formats
- Test blog post navigation
- Test responsiveness on different devices
- Test accessibility with keyboard navigation and screen readers
- Test loading states and error handling

## Notes
- The blog directory already contains some markdown files that can be used for testing
- The blog renderer now includes a custom markdown parser with frontmatter support
- The blog integrates seamlessly with the existing portfolio design
- This implementation is extensible for future blog enhancements
- Added copy code functionality for code blocks in blog posts
- Implemented related posts feature based on shared tags
- Enhanced markdown to HTML conversion with proper Tailwind styling

## Out of Scope
- Full blog administration interface
- Comment system for blog posts
- Blog post search functionality (can be added in a future story)
- Blog post analytics
- RSS feed generation
