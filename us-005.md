## Implementation Steps
1. Create form handler in js/form-handler.js:
   - Implement form validation logic
   - Handle form submission
   - Add success/error state management
   - Implement spam protection

2. Create contact section component (components/contact-section.js):
   - Design responsive contact form layout
   - Add contact information display
   - Include professional networking links
   - Implement form state management

3. Update index.html:
   - Add contact section to the main page
   - Include proper semantic HTML structure
   - Add accessibility attributes
   - Ensure consistent navigation

4. Style the contact elements:
   - Use Tailwind for consistent styling
   - Add custom animations for social icons

5. Implement form submission handling:
   - Set up form submission endpoint (or email service)
   - Add loading states and feedback
   - Handle error scenarios gracefully
   - Test form functionality thoroughly

## Design Considerations

- Add subtle animations for interactions
- Implement smooth transitions between states
- Optimize for mobile and desktop experiences

## Performance Considerations
- Load contact section asynchronously if needed

- Cache form submission responses

## Testing Strategy
- Test form validation with various inputs
- Test form submission success and error scenarios
- Test responsiveness on different devices
- Test accessibility with keyboard navigation and screen readers
- Test social media links functionality
- Test spam protection effectiveness

## Notes
- Consider using a service like Formspree, Netlify Forms, or EmailJS for form submission
- The contact section should be easily accessible from the main navigation
- Professional networking links should open in new tabs with proper attributes
- Consider adding a "Download Resume" button in the contact section
- The implementation should be extensible for adding more contact methods in the future
