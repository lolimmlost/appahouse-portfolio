User Story 2: Implement Real GitHub API Integration
Story Title
As a portfolio owner, I want to display my actual GitHub activity on my portfolio so that visitors can see my recent contributions and coding activity.

User Story
As a portfolio owner,

I want to integrate my actual GitHub account with the portfolio website,

So that visitors can view my real-time coding activity, contributions, and project history.

Acceptance Criteria
 The GitHub API integration must use a real GitHub username instead of the placeholder 'your-username'
 The portfolio must display actual commit history from my GitHub repositories
 The commit visualization must accurately represent the distribution of commits across repositories
 The GitHub profile link must direct to my actual GitHub profile
 The integration must handle API rate limits gracefully
 Error messages must be user-friendly when GitHub API is unavailable
 The integration must include loading states during API fetches
 The component must be responsive and work well on all device sizes
Technical Requirements
GitHub API Integration
Replace the placeholder username in js/github-api.js with the actual GitHub username
Implement proper error handling for GitHub API requests
Add loading states during API fetches
Handle GitHub API rate limits (60 requests per hour for unauthenticated requests)
Cache GitHub activity data to reduce API calls
UI/UX Requirements
Display a loading indicator while fetching GitHub data
Show user-friendly error messages when the API is unavailable
Ensure the commit visualization is responsive and accessible
Add a "Last updated" timestamp to show when the data was fetched
Performance Considerations
Implement caching to reduce API calls
Use debouncing or throttling if implementing refresh functionality
Consider using a service worker to cache GitHub API responses
Implementation Approach
Phase 1: Basic Integration
Update the GitHub username in js/github-api.js
Test the API integration with real data
Ensure error handling works correctly
Phase 2: Enhanced User Experience
Add loading states during API fetches
Implement caching mechanism
Add "Last updated" timestamp
Improve error messages
Phase 3: Performance Optimization
Implement more sophisticated caching strategies
Add refresh functionality with rate limit awareness
Consider implementing a fallback mechanism for when API limits are reached
Mockups and Design References
Current Design
The current GitHub activity section displays:

A progress bar visualization of commit distribution across repositories
Repository names and commit counts
A link to the GitHub profile
Enhanced Design
The enhanced GitHub activity section should include:

A loading spinner while fetching data
A "Last updated" timestamp
More detailed commit information (e.g., commit messages, timestamps)
A refresh button with rate limit awareness
Better error states with suggestions
Dependencies and Resources
GitHub REST API documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/rest
GitHub API rate limiting: https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#rate-limiting
No additional npm packages required (using native fetch API)
Testing Strategy
Test with a real GitHub account that has public activity
Test error scenarios (network issues, API rate limits, non-existent users)
Test loading states and transitions
Test responsiveness across different device sizes
Test accessibility with keyboard navigation and screen readers
Notes and Assumptions
The GitHub username will need to be configured as an environment variable or directly in the code
The implementation assumes the user has a public GitHub profile with public repositories
The GitHub API has rate limits, so caching is essential for a good user experience
The implementation should handle cases where the user has no recent GitHub activity
Out of Scope
Authentication with GitHub (using unauthenticated API requests)
Displaying private repository activity
Implementing a full GitHub dashboard (focusing on commit activity only)
Storing GitHub data in a database (client-side caching only)
